# How to use

First edit the config.py file with your:
- Redbubble Email
- Redbubble Password
- Path to Chrome Webdriver (This was built using Brave Browser or Chromium 93)
- Folder with all of the images you'd like as stickers



The bot will run up to 60 times before failure (Redbubble caps out number of uplaods per day at 60)
